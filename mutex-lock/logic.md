let's break down the provided C++ code step by step and explain each component in detail.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>
```
  
These are the include directives, which import necessary header files for input/output, queue data structure, mutex (mutual exclusion) mechanism, and thread management.

```cpp
std::queue<int> globalQueue;
```
This line declares a global std::queue object named globalQueue, which will store integers.

```cpp
std::mutex mutexLock;
```
  
A std::mutex object named mutexLock is declared. A mutex is used for synchronization between threads, ensuring that only one thread can access a specific section of code (protected by the mutex) at a time. This helps prevent data races and concurrent access issues.

```cpp
int THREAD_COUNT = 5000;
```

An integer variable THREAD_COUNT is declared and initialized with the value 5000. This variable represents the number of threads that will be created.

```cpp
void ThreadFunction(int index) {
    mutexLock.lock();
    globalQueue.push(index);
    mutexLock.unlock();
}
```
  
This is the definition of the ThreadFunction. Each thread will execute this function. When a thread is spawned, it takes an index as an argument. Within the function, the mutex is locked using mutexLock.lock() to ensure exclusive access to the critical section. The thread then adds the index value to the globalQueue using the push() method of the queue. Finally, the mutex is unlocked using mutexLock.unlock() to allow other threads to access the critical section.

```cpp
int main() {
    std::thread threads[THREAD_COUNT];

    for (int i = 0; i < THREAD_COUNT; i++) {
        threads[i] = std::thread(ThreadFunction, i);
    }
```
                        
In the main function, an array of std::thread objects named threads is declared with a size of THREAD_COUNT (5000 in this case). A loop is used to create and start multiple threads, each associated with the ThreadFunction. The i value is passed as an argument to the ThreadFunction for each thread.

```cpp
std::cout << "Size of the global queue: " << globalQueue.size();
```
After spawning all the threads, this line attempts to print the size of the globalQueue to the console. However, since there is no synchronization mechanism between the threads and the main function, there is a chance that the threads may not have completed their work before this line executes. This can lead to incorrect output because the queue may not be fully populated yet.
